# Automated Twitter Handle Changer
This script was meant as a quick and dirty method to automate the process of changing a user's twitter handle. 

To emphasize the "quick and drity" part, we're using selenium to automate the browser to perform this task.
It works, but it's very likely to contain bugs especially since some of the code relies on xpaths vs css_selector etc.
